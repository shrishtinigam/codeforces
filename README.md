# Codeforces solution
A repository showcasing solutions to challenges from codeforces.

My current is code templete is

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <ios>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>
#include <set>
#include <map>
using namespace std;
#define rep(i,a,b) for (int i = a; i < b; i++)
#define rep2(i,a,b) for (int i = a; i > b; i--)
#define ll long long
#define pb push_back
#define mp make_pair

int main()
{
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
}
```


I add and remove header files as necessary during practice. During competitions, I use <bits/stdc++.h> to save time.
I have completed and uploaded the solutions to Ladder 11 of https://a2oj.com/Ladders.html
